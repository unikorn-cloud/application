          ApplicationSet defines a set of applications.
          It works like a normal package manager, installing a package will automatically
          install any dependencies and recommended packages.  Removeing a package will also
          remove any dependencies and recoomended packages unless they are kept alive by
          another package in the set.

              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.
